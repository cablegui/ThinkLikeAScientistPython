    "2. Using the Python interpreter, type 1 + 2 and then hit return. Python evaluates this\n",
    "expression, displays the result, and then shows another prompt. * is the multiplication\n",

    "3. Type 1 2 and then hit return. Python tries to evaluate the expression, but it can’t because\n",
    "the expression is not syntactically legal. Instead, it shows the error message:\n",
    "File \"<interactive input>\", line 1\n",

    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "In many cases, Python indicates where the syntax error occurred, but it is not always\n",
    "right, and it doesn’t give you much information about what is wrong.\n",
    "So, for the most part, the burden is on you to learn the syntax rules.\n",
    "In this case, Python is complaining because there is no operator between the numbers.\n",
    "See if you can find a few more examples of things that will produce error messages when\n",
    "you enter them at the Python prompt. Write down what you enter at the prompt and the\n",

    "4. Type print(\"hello\"). Python executes this, which has the effect of printing the\n",
    "letters h-e-l-l-o. Notice that the quotation marks that you used to enclose the string are\n",

    "NameError: name ’cheese’ is not defined\n",
    "This is a run-time error; specifically, it is a NameError, and even more specifically, it is\n",

    "6. Type 6 + 4 * 9 at the Python prompt and hit enter. Record what happens.\n",
    "Now create a Python script with the following contents:\n",
    "6 + 4 * 9\n",
    "What happens when you run this script? Now change the script contents to:\n",

    "expression you’ll get the result 42.)\n",
    "A script is different, however. Evaluations of expressions are not automatically displayed,\n",
    "so it is necessary to use the print function to make the answer show up.\n",
